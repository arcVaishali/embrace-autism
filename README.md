# Embrace-Autism 🧩

*A digital platform to support and empower individuals on the autism spectrum.*

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Embrace-Autism** is a web-app designed to create a safe, accessible, and inclusive space for autistic users — both children and adults — offering features such as voice-based interaction, text-to-speech support, and community resources to aid learning, communication, and growth.

The motivation behind this project is to use technology — especially modern web stacks and accessibility tools — to reduce barriers for neurodiverse individuals and help them feel understood, supported, and empowered.

## 🎯 Features

* **User-friendly interface**: Clean UI, intuitive navigation suitable for children and adults.
* **Voice-assisted interactions**: Text-to-speech and voice recognition features to help users with communication difficulties.
* **Accessibility-focused design**: Tailored to neurodivergent needs (readability, simplicity, minimal distractions).
* **Support & Resource Hub**: Age-appropriate content, community resources, potentially stories or learning modules.
* **Responsive Full-Stack Architecture**: Client and server structure, enabling scalability and maintainability.

> *Note:* Some features are in development — see *Future Roadmap* below.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Frontend**: JavaScript (React or similar for UI) — for interactive, dynamic UIs
* **Backend / API**: Node.js / Express or another JS-based server — powering data, auth, interactions
* **Database / Storage**: MongoDB
* **Hosting / Deployment**: Vercel (or similar) for client side; standard hosting for server side — enabling continuous deployment

*(Adjust above depending on your actual stack — e.g. if you used React, Express, MongoDB / Firebase, etc.)*

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
/client   — Frontend code (UI, components, assets)  
/server   — Backend code (API endpoints, database models, services)  
README.md — This file  
.env.sample (or .env) — Environment variables template  
...other config / utility / doc files  
```

*This structure helps separate concerns, making it easier to maintain frontend and backend independently.*

## 🔧 Installation & Setup (Local Development)

> These instructions assume you have Git, Node.js (with npm or yarn), and optionally a database setup (if your project uses one).

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arcVaishali/embrace-autism.git
   cd embrace-autism
   ```

2. **Set up backend**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install        # or yarn install
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Update .env with required variables (e.g. DB credentials, API keys)
   npm start          # or yarn start / npm run dev
   ```
2. **.env.sample file**
   ```
   MONGODBURI=""
   PORT=5000
   CORS_ORIGIN = "http://localhost:3000"
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
   ```

3. **Set up frontend**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install        # or yarn install
   npm start          # or yarn dev
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port defined in your config)

Adjust above as per your actual ports, config, and environment setup.

## 📖 Usage & Demo

*(If you already have a deployed version or screenshots — include here. If not, you can later add “Live Demo” link or screenshots.)*

```text
# Example of using the app (pseudo flow)
- User visits homepage → selects “Child Interface” or “Adult Interface”
- User logs in / signs up (if applicable)
- User can choose voice-based interaction or normal UI
- User navigates to resource hub / learning modules / community section
- User accesses content in accessible format (text-to-speech, simple UI)
```

You can also include GIFs or screenshots to help users quickly understand how the app looks and works. ([GitHub][1])
